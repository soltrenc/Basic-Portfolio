        <p>
            I was born and raised in Perth Amboy, NJ. I graduated from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, NJ back in
            2012.
            As I was growing up, I played organized sports in basketball and baseball with interests in gaming.
            I received an academic scholarship to Northwood University down in West Palm Beach, FL where I went for 4
            years
            to obtain my Bachelors of Business Administration and majoring in Finance.
            I worked a few temp jobs after I graduated, bouncing around the industry trying to figure out where I fit
            best.
            My first job I worked for a broker dealer firm, setting up 403b's, mutual funds, and annuities for clients.
            I
            also did much admistrative work like scanning important documents to the cloud, and sorting mail.
            I then went onto doing some accounts receivable work for a hospitality management corporation. After that, I
            did
            a lot of customer service as a front desk admin for a manufacturing company.
            After working those jobs I felt like I needed a change and wanted to relocate back home to NJ in hopes of
            better
            opportunity.
            So far, I've been working for a real estate company, kind of doing payroll basically ensuring all agents who
            sell properties across the Tri-State area, Pennsyvlania, and Connecticut get cut the right commission
            checks.
            I found myself feeling like this may also not be the best fit for me so I wanted to do something different
            maybe
            learn a skill that can set me apart from others in the industry.
            That's where I am today and why I am now enrolled in this bootcamp so I can learn something new, something
            that
            can hopefully elevate me to the next level into really beginning my career as a web developer.
